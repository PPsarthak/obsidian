Scaling is a strategy for increasing a system’s capacity and performance as demand grows. It allows systems to handle more requests, data, and users by increasing resources.

---
- **Horizontal Scaling** (or “scaling out”) adds more servers or nodes to distribute the workload.
- Distributing data or requests evenly across multiple nodes using [[Load Balancing]].
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Vertical Scaling** (or “scaling up”) increases the capacity of a single server by adding more resources (CPU, memory, storage).
- Upgrading server hardware like RAM, CPU, or disk space to handle more tasks or data.
- Failure in a vertically scaled system affects the entire service.
