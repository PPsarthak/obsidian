## Glossary
- Extension of Factory Design Pattern for creating families of objects

Assume we have a `Vehicle` interface and `Car` and `Bus` implementing it. 
This code can be written using Factory Method Design Pattern too. Now let's assume we have 2 `Car` - `Electric` and `Diesel` and similarly,  2 `Bus` - `Electric` and `Diesel`

#### UML Class Diagram (My approach)
![[UML Class Diagram for Abstract Factory Design Pattern.png|950]]

This approach does not violate OCP -
- if a `Truck` needs to be created, we can simply implement `Vehicle`, then create a new `Electric Truck Factory` and `Diesel Truck Factory`
- if a new family of vehicles `CNG` needs to be added, we can add a new interface `CNG Factory` and have create it's sub-classes
