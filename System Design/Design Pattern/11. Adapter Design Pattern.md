## Glossary
- Adapter design pattern is used to make a classess/entites compatible with the client (or another class)
- A simple example to understand this is US-weighing system (in lbs) and Indian-weighing system (in kgs). Here an adapter would be a converter between the 2 weighing standards

##### Terminologies
**Adapter**: Resolves compatability issue
**Adaptee**: The actual object that performs the core business logic. (and has compatability issue with client)
(Compatability issue may arise because of a change request or maybe some clients want the adaptee to return the way it returns the result while some clients want to involve the adapter and make it compatibile because they don't want the default result)
### UML Class Diagram

### Code
```java
public interface ImperialWeighingMachine {
	double getWeightInPounds();
}

public class ImperialWeighingMachineImpl implements ImperialWeighingMachine {
	@Override
   public double getWeightInPounds(){
	   //returns in pounds
   }
}

//Adapter
public interface WeighingMachineAdapter {
	double getWeightInKg(); 
}

public class WeightMachineAdapterImpl implements WeighingMachineAdapter {
	// Adaptee Reference
	ImperialWeighingMachine imperialWeighingMachine;
	
	@Override
	public double getWeightInKg() {
		double weightInPound = imperialWeighingMachine.getWeightInPounds();
		// Conversion formula: 1 pound = 0.453592 kg
		return weightInPound * 0.45;
	}
}
```
