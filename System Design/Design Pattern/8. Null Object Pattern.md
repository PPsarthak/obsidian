## Glossary
- The Null Object Pattern uses an object as a substitute when a real object is not present. 
- The Null Object either does nothing or executes the default behavior
- This helps simplify your code by removing the need for explicit null checks - `if (object != null)` (NullPointerExceptions is reduced)

> [!note]
> As null objects should not have any state, there’s no need to create identical instances multiple times. Thus, we’ll often implement null objects as singletons.
