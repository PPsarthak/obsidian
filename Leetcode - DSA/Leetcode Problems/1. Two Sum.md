##### Problem Description
```
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
```

##### Code
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> numMap = new HashMap<>();
        int n = nums.length;

        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) numMap.put(nums[i], i);

        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            //find if the complement is present in the map 
            //&& ensure that index of complement is not the same number
            // for eg [3,2,4] if we have 3 then we don't want to select 3 again
            if (numMap.containsKey(complement) && numMap.get(complement) != i) {
                return new int[]{i, numMap.get(complement)};
            }
        }

        return new int[]{}; // No solution found
    }
}
```
