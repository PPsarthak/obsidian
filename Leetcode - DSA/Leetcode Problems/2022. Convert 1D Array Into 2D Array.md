#Leetcode #Problems #Arrays 
##### Problem Description
You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n. You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with  m rows and n columns using all the elements from original.

The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.

Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it is impossible.

##### Code
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[][] construct2DArray(int[] arr, int m, int n) {
        if(m*n !=arr.length) return new int[][]{};

        int[][] ans = new int[m][n];
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        for(int e : arr){
            if(j == n){
                i++;
                j=0;
            }

            ans[i][j++] = e;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
