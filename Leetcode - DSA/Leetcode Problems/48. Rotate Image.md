#Leetcode #Problems #Arrays #Matrix 
##### Problem Description
```
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
```

##### Code
```Java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int[][] ref = new int[n][n];

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<n; j++) ref[j][n-1-i] = matrix[i][j];
        }

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<n; j++) matrix[i][j] = ref[i][j];
        }
    }
}
```
