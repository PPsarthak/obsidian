##### 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix
Given a matrix identify the k weakest rows in a binary matrix where rows are considered weaker based on the number of soldiers (1s) they contain and, if tied, by the row index. The task is to return the indices of these k weakest rows, ordered from weakest to strongest
###### Explanation

##### 506. Relative Ranks
Given an array representing athlete scores in a competition, the task is to determine and return the rank of each athlete based on their score. The top three athletes receive "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", and "Bronze Medal", respectively, while the remaining athletes are ranked by their placement number. 

##### 1046. Last Stone Weight
Given an array of stones, the two heaviest stones are repeatedly smashed together until at most one stone remains. If the stones have equal weight, both are destroyed; otherwise, the lighter stone is destroyed and the heavier stone's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter stone. The objective is to return the weight of the last remaining stone or 0 if no stones are left.

##### 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream
The task is to design a class, `KthLargest`, that efficiently tracks the k-th largest element in a continuously updating stream of scores. The class initializes with an integer k and an initial array of scores, and it must dynamically return the k-th largest score after each new score is added to the stream,

##### 2099. Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, the task is to find a subsequence of nums with length k that yields the largest possible sum. The function should return any such subsequence as an integer array of length k, where a subsequence is derived by deleting elements without altering the order of the remaining elements.
