#leetcode #greedy

###### Basic Pattern
```
In Greedy problems, the standard approach is to make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope that these choices lead to a globally optimal solution. 
The key is to identify a greedy choice property — a rule that, if followed, never blocks you from reaching the best answer.
