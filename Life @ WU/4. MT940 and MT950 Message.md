#western-union #mt-940

> [!info] 
> MT940:
Designed for reconciliation.
Contains many :61 (transaction) lines and detailed :86 narratives.
Corporates use it to match payments with invoices.

> [!info] 
> MT950:
Designed for daily account balance reporting.
Focuses on opening/closing/available balances.
:61 transactions may appear, but not always — some banks only include balances, not full transaction detail. 

> [!info] 
> MT940 focuses heavily on tag :61: and :86:
> MT950 may be lighter or absent because only balances matter since it is a summarized version of MT940
