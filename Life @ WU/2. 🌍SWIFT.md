#### What is SWIFT?
SWIFT stands for **Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications**
It is a global messaging network that facilitates cross-border financial transactions.
It actually sets standards for instructions and messages
It is not a payment system itself, but rather the communication backbone that allows financial institutions to send secure, accurate instructions for money transfers

> Each bank that facilitates cross-border transaction has a unique SWIFT code (also c/a BIC - Bank Identifier Code)
#### Why SWIFT is Important?
*Global Connectivity*: The network connects over 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries
*Standardization*: SWIFT's standardized messaging protocol ensures consistency and automation in financial communications, reducing errors and inefficiencies in cross-border transactions
