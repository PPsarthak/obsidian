#### Basic Treasury Concepts
Treasury in a corporate or banking context mainly deals with cash, liquidity, and risk management. Some core areas are:

- *Cash Management*: Ensuring there’s enough cash available for daily operations (payroll, vendors, etc.) while investing surplus efficiently.
- *Liquidity Management*: Monitoring inflows/outflows and short-term borrowing/lending to stay solvent.
- *Payments & Collections*: Handling outgoing payments (to suppliers, employees, taxes) and incoming funds (from customers).
- *Bank Reconciliation*: Matching company records with bank statements to ensure accuracy.
- *Risk Management*: Hedging against risks like currency fluctuations, interest rate changes, and counterparty risk.
- *Investments & Borrowings*: Placing surplus funds or raising capital through short/long-term instruments.
