#daily-notes 

- Woke up late, nagpanchami today, so mavshi was not going to come - so slept little longer
- Having a little pain in the tooth, booked an appointment of dentist at Silver Park
- Saw Sanjay Pawar in his Wonder Kids Van passing by at 12.11 
- Turns out the pain is way too serious, after x-ray saw that the tooth is coming out in a slanting position and needs to be surgically removed -

- Appointment is booked for tomorrow 
- Called the HR Suraj Kirad for doubts at 3PM. Filled in the remaining details, just one task remains which will be filled on the DOJ
- Couldn't have dinner much, pops brought butterscotch family pack, ate a whole lot of ice-cream 😋
