#daily-notes 

- visited the doctor for operation again, he told about the IAN nerve which is below the tooth. the lady doctor forgot to include that in the X-ray yesterday. 
- he also said he is not that trained, so he is calling a freelancing surgeon
- dropped him, pops took a half-day and went to lodha dentist at mumbai naka (he is the one you used to go to in your childhood)
- he took the x-ray and properly noticed that wisdom tooth might touch the IAN, so went to CDBT scan / 3D scan of lower jaw at Archies Gallery (College Road)
- turns out, 1 leg is touching that nerve, not the remaining ones - will do the surgery tomorrow.
