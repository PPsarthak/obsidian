#daily-notes 

-  Woke up lazy today, raining again today, walked at home
- Mom and Pops again going to same show as yesterday
- Watched Day 5 today - what a draw
- Started solving Trees now, solved a lot of questions
- Went for an evening walk - had samosa + vada pav
- On the way back home, tooth started to hurt more, skipped going to dentist and skipped dinner as I was full
