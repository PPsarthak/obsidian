**Tell me about yourself**
I am Sarthak Pandit - an undergraduate student pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunication engineering from VIT.
I have worked as Associate Software Developer Intern at IDeaS for the last 6 months - getting on hands-on experience in Java/Spring Boot and MySQL by working 2 of their products. I am currently pursuing opportunities of Internship and Placement pertaining to software development in Java Spring Boot 

**Explain your tenure at IDeaS**
I worked as a Associate Software Developer Intern at IDeaS from July 24 to Dec 24. 

*What IDeaS does?* 
	Speaking about IDeaS, it is in the Revenue Solution Industry i.e., it has products that caters to hotel and hospitality industry. I worked on 2 products -  G2 and Elevate. My primary work was on Elevate - which provides 3 decisions to hotels - BAR, Overbooking, LRV. 
	BAR means the best available rate that is applicable to any customer that walks-in from the front door of the hotel and the hotel can sell that room/package to get maximum revenue
	Similarly, overbooking refers to how much of high demand can the hotel expect and LRV is last room value i.e., the value below which the hotel should not sell any room when expecting a higher demand
	To do this, they have their own algorithms and IP that uses the hotel's daily occupancy data - rooms sold, revenue generated etc.
	
As part of my role, I worked on the backend in Java, Spring Boot, MySQL. As part of my tenure, I worked on a couple of development stories - API development, bug fixes, E2E test-cases, CI/CD pipelines.
I designed and developed the purging framework to delete old production data. This greatly impacted the costing of Relational Database costing on RDS
I worked on a automation story for a microservice; I worked on end-to-end test case, postman migration to name a few
More than that, I got experience on using tools like - JIRA, Confluence, even Microsoft Teams and Outlook, 

*Funny* - And yes, how can I be a part of corporate and not learn how to play TT?

**Why did you choose E&TC?**
Well, I will be honest about it. My primary goal after completing my 12th and JEE was to get into the best-possible college. 
Based on my score, VIT was the most-suitable option for me. I did try to get a seat in CSE or related-branches, but still landing E&TC in a pristine college of Pune was fine for me, And so far, I absolutely don't regret my decision, because I got the opportunity to get the best of both worlds - IT-related branches and core-branches in the IT-hub of my home state (or just say Maharashtra)

**Why do you want to transition in IT/software?**
The introduction of IT/Software related companies was inevitable when I moved to Pune.  

**Strengths and weakness**
strength
I thrive when it comes to think for a  "out of the box" solution. During my time at IDeaS, I got to work 2 such stories - designing the purging framework and for killing slow running queries on production

weakness
Sometimes expectations - I like to keep some expectations but the thing is sometimes when I don't meet those expectations I am left unsatisfied with my progress.
Let me give you an example - when I joined IDeaS, I did set some expectations from myself. I thought of proving myself from the start, performing very well. But, when I started working it took me a lot of time to get through the work. I made some constant mistakes for which I had to revisit and do the entire thing again. Those were small things but those were very important from business perspective. The lesson I learned - Always be thorough with your knowledge and understanding before working on it. In the first few weeks, I didn't discuss a lot about the business logic with my technical lead, so when I was working on a story, I would get confused or miss out on some important things. 
So when I finally started understanding the business logic, things became smooth for me

**Where do you see yourself in 5 years?**
In the next 5 years, I would like to be a part of a company that has offered me great opportunities to grow and yet continue to offer me more opportunities to grow further.
I would want that I have excelled in my skills so far and be confident to continue further.
*One liner* - In the next 5 years, I would like to look back 5 years and I want myself to be satisfied with my decisions and progress I have made so far

**Why do you want to join us?**
Currently, I am pursuing opportunities of placement. Your company is currently offering the same through internship, which is ideal for me. Moreover, it provides me the opportunity to work on Java/Spring Boot, which I have previously worked on for 6 months. So it is a excellent way for me to showcase my skills to you, learn from you and excel in professional career.

**How do you stay updated in your domain?**
*Witty* - Well, when you are student it really is easy! Just try to look for what different companies on-campus are looking for - Python/ML/Java or Spring Boot, etc. 
Anyways but YouTube, blogs on Google, Reddit are excellent ways to keep yourself updated
