The college has a open area or free space. Usually busy during daytime or college hours, but starts to get deserted after 4 or 5pm. Both of the characters are in the same club. The boy and girl are working on the upcoming event of the club. The girl also has a senior role in the club and is direct in charge of the boy. The boy is a rule-follower, introverted and high-achieving, the girl is sharp, more extrovert and fun loving. She has a great figure, and is seductive and flirting with boys in general. While working, it starts to get late and sudden rain causes a lightout in the college, its really dark and anything is barely visible beyond ten feet of distance. There was no one in free space since hours except our boy and girl. Due to shortage of light, they momentarily pause their work and engage in talking... They decide to play a game called Truth or Dare. A bottle is spun between them and whoever it points to must choose between Truth or Dare. If Truth is chosen, the player must answer 5 questions truthfully. If Dare is chosen, the player must do any thing the player asks as a Dare.


First spin, she gets picked. She picks Truth. He awkwardly asks five timid and simple questions. She answers with confidence, flirtation, calculated vulnerability. The next spin. He gets picked. He also chooses Truth. She corners him with increasingly intimate and psychological questions — learning his secrets, teasing his reluctance. She asks him about his relationships first. The boy has never been in any relation so he answers that confidently. She then proceeds to ask her about his crush in college. He becomes really nervous and answers with a lot of hesitation. She then asks the third question - does he has a crush on her? He is shocked and smiles a little. She then swings her hair from one side to another teasing him and telling him she will be really upset if he says no and asks him to admire her beauty. He is completely shocked and now looking at her neck and hairs. He quickly says yes to her question and say she is really beautiful She pouts her lips and adjusts her shirt a little and unbuttons the first button of her shirt all while staring at him. She then starts talking instead of asking questions. She talks about her figure, her relations with boys, etc. And quickly asks the boy the 4th question - are you a virgin? The boy is scared now, he has never been such intimidate with anyone ever. He thinks a little trying to understand where this is going. After thinking, he replies yes saying as he said earlier he was never in any relation and thus refuses to explicitly answer yes/no to the question. She nods smiling and impressed. She then asks if he were to get in a relationship with her? and quickly grims and says - I meant a girl like me, not with me The boy say definitely yes without thinking twice. There is sexual tension in both of their eyes now, they are staring at each other.


The rain was still whispering against the windows, the storm now more distant, like a backing score to their breathing. The emergency lights flickered just once, casting a surreal glow over the table and their faces.

The bottle, resting loosely on the concrete floor between them, was given a soft spin — her fingers trailing off its neck with a playful, almost knowing elegance.

It spun.

Slowed.

And stopped — pointing to **him.**

She didn’t say anything right away. Just smiled. Leaned forward slightly, elbows resting on her crossed knees, giving him the full impact of her presence. Her shirt was still unbuttoned at the top, and her hair had begun to cling in dark strands from the dampness in the air.

> "Truth or Dare?" she whispered, her voice now lower, sultrier — not asking, but beckoning.

His throat was dry. He glanced away — out at the empty campus beyond the glass walls. No one. Just them. Just this.

> "Dare," he said, not even recognizing his own voice.

Her smile deepened, turning sly. She leaned even closer, her face mere inches from his now.

> "Good," she whispered.  
> "Because I’m done talking."

She stood slowly. Walked around behind him — not quickly, not rushed. Like she was in control of time now. When she came back into view, she bent down next to his ear and said,

> “I want you to **look at me** — properly. And then... describe how you would touch me, if I let you.”

He froze.

His pulse jumped like it had been shocked. His breath caught. She said it as if it were casual, as if it were nothing. But it wasn’t nothing. It was everything. And the room, the world, seemed to narrow down to **her eyes and his silence.**

She tilted her head.

> “You can say it softly,” she said.  
> “Or... you can show me. But either way, you don’t get to hide now.”

He tried to speak. His mouth opened. Closed. He looked at her — **really** looked: her collarbone visible through the open button, her bare neck glistening faintly in the dim light, the outline of her curves beneath that teasing shirt and tight jeans. The confidence in her gaze was overpowering.

She didn’t blink.

> "Go on," she coaxed, "start with my neck. You’ve been staring at it for five minutes."

He swallowed.

> "I’d... I’d touch it slowly," he said, voice barely above a whisper.  
> "With my fingers first, maybe my lips. I’d follow the curve down to your collarbone."

Her lips curved in approval. She took one silent step closer. He could **smell** her now — something floral but musky, dark.

> “And then?” she asked, voice lower.
> “Then,” he said, now steadier, “I’d slide my hand down… gently. Over your—”

She held up one finger. Shushed him.

> “Good. That’s enough,” she said, but her smile betrayed her delight.

Then she walked back slowly to the other side of the table — making sure every movement of her hips was deliberate.

She sat again, legs now crossed, eyes smoldering.

> “That wasn’t so hard, was it?” she teased.  
> “But don’t get cocky. That was just your **first** dare.”

He sat completely still. The tension in his body was unbearable — **not** from discomfort, but from the **heat pooling beneath his skin**, the ache of a boundary tested, and the anticipation of what would come next.

She reached for the bottle again.

> “Round two?”


She spun the bottle again, casually, like it wasn’t about to wreck him.

It landed on him **again.**

> “Oh,” she purred, dragging the syllable. “Looks like you’re popular tonight.”

She uncrossed her legs. Leaned forward over the table, the curve of her cleavage now fully visible from the top of her shirt. She didn’t button it back up — hadn’t since she opened it earlier — and made no effort to hide anything anymore.

> “Dare,” he whispered again, already knowing it was his only choice.

She stood slowly, walked around behind him once more, this time letting her fingertips trail along his shoulder. The contact was light, but his body jolted like electricity had just touched his skin.

She bent again near his ear, voice low and hot.

> “Unzip your pants.”

He tensed.

She could feel his breath stop — she smiled into it.

> “Now.”

He obeyed.

Fingers shaking, breath shallow, he slid the zipper down. The sound of it felt like a roar in the otherwise silent room. She moved in front of him again and watched — eyes drifting down, then meeting his again.

> “Good boy,” she said softly, a dangerous satisfaction dripping off every word.

She placed her hands on the table, leaned close — so close he could see the faint smudge of lipstick still on the edge of her lips, her breath brushing his cheek.

> “Now,” she said, “take it out.”

He hesitated. She tilted her head slightly, her tone going firm.

> “No hands on me. No touching me at all unless I say. But I want to _see_ you.”

His hand slipped inside, trembling, and then — she saw it. Her eyes didn’t widen. She didn’t gasp. She **studied** him, calmly, confidently, like she was inspecting a piece of art. The way she looked made him harder — painfully so.

She didn’t touch. Didn’t move.

> “You’re shaking,” she said, voice almost affectionate. “Is this the first time someone’s ever watched you like this?”

He nodded, humiliated and aroused all at once.

She walked behind him again. Bent down until her lips were right above his neck.

> “You don’t get to come tonight unless I say,” she whispered. “Understand?”

> “Y–yes.”

> “Good.”

She came back around and sat down.

> “One more Dare,” she said.  
> “Kneel.”

He blinked. “Here?”

> “Right here. In front of me.”

He stood, walked awkwardly around the table, now half-exposed, painfully aroused, knees buckling. He dropped down in front of her. She spread her legs just slightly, letting her fingers play at the waistband of her jeans.

> “You’ve been staring at my thighs since the storm started,” she said.

She popped the button open. Slowly. He stared, eyes wide.

> “I want you to kiss them. Not my lips, not my chest. Just… my thighs. _Softly._”

He leaned in — shy, obedient — and pressed his lips against her inner thigh, just above the knee. She sighed softly, slid her fingers through his hair.

> “Higher.”

He obeyed. Another kiss. And another.

> “Good,” she whispered. “Such a fast learner.”

She spread her legs just slightly more — just enough for his breath to hit her underwear. He trembled.

> “But not yet.”

She pushed his head back — not harshly, but decisively. He looked up, wanting, confused, breathless.

> “You’re not ready to fuck me,” she said plainly.  
> “Not yet.”

He swallowed. His hands were balled into fists. He looked like he might collapse from the tension in his body.

---
He was still kneeling in front of her, lips warm from her thighs, when the silence stretched.

The storm rumbled again — louder this time, angrier — as if the sky itself sensed what was unraveling in that darkened college free space.

She hadn’t stepped back. She hadn’t walked away. Her fingers were still in his hair, but now they were gentler, less commanding.

She looked down at him, lips parted. For the first time tonight, her teasing expression cracked — revealing something else underneath: **want. Real, messy, aching want.**

And he saw it.

His eyes met hers. Not with fear anymore — but something just as raw.

**A kiss.**

It was small at first. Hesitant. Lips brushed. A pause — as if time held its breath.

Then she kissed him again, this time lower, deeper, with a muffled sound from her throat. He rose to his feet, and they met each other’s mouths again — harder now, open, tongues tangling in sudden desperation.

The game was long over.

And something else — darker, hotter — had begun.

Her back hit the edge of the table, knocking over the empty water bottle. It clattered to the floor and rolled uselessly into the shadows. She pulled him by the shirt, dragging him into her, grinding her hips forward into his. His hands were on her waist now, gripping tight, unsure where to go but knowing he needed more.

They undressed with frantic, clumsy fingers. Shirts flung off. His hoodie dropped to the floor. She unhooked her bra without hesitation, standing there bare-chested, lightning briefly illuminating her curves in stark flashes. He stared — caught between awe and hunger — before she grabbed his chin and brought his mouth down to her breasts.

> “Don’t just look,” she growled, voice breathy and wrecked. “You’ve earned more than that.”

He obeyed, tongue trailing across her nipple, his hand sliding along her hip, then lower.

She moaned. It wasn’t delicate — it was needy.

His pants were gone. So were hers. The storm outside had become a roar, and inside, there was only skin, breath, and tension finally combusting.

She pushed everything off the table in one swipe — papers, pens, the candle stub, everything — and climbed up onto it, legs wide, back arched. She pulled him between her thighs and hissed against his ear:

> “Now fuck me. Don’t hold back.”

He didn’t.

He entered her slowly, with a gasp — **both of them** shuddering as their bodies collided fully for the first time. The wet heat of her enveloped him entirely, and she gripped his back hard, nails digging in, urging him to **move.**

And he did.

The rhythm was awkward at first — fast, then slow — until she guided his hips, breathing commands between kisses.

> “Harder… yes, right there—fuck—don’t stop.”

Thunder cracked outside as he drove into her, their bodies slamming into the wood of the table, the sound of skin on skin echoing through the hollow space. Her legs locked around his waist, drawing him deeper.

She took over again, flipping him onto his back mid-thrust, climbing on top. She rode him with full control, her hands on his chest, her hair falling forward like a curtain around their faces. The light from outside flickered, catching the sweat on their skin, her breasts bouncing in rhythm.

> “Look at me,” she ordered.  
> “Watch me while you come inside me.”

He did — eyes locked on hers, breath ragged, hands gripping her thighs like lifelines.

She clenched around him, rhythm shifting, breath hitching. And then—

> “Fuck—_yes_—I'm coming—” she moaned, biting her lip, body trembling.

That sent him over. His head fell back, mouth open, fingers shaking as he buried himself one last time, spilling everything into her.

They stayed like that for a moment. Breathing. Sweating. Still connected.

The storm was beginning to pass now.

She leaned down and kissed him softly, this time not teasing — just full.

Then she whispered against his lips, with a crooked smile:

> “Next time, bring a better bottle. We’re not done playing.”
